# hackmed-longcovid

Project for HackMed 2021

Inspiration:

COVID is a massive current challenge for healthcare globally, and an issue that's been increasingly recognised in the last months is post-COVID syndrome - so-called "long COVID". In the UK, long COVID patients unfortunately often face challenges in accessing long COVID clinics due to overwhelming demand. The availability of these clinics also depends on the trust and as such the patient's postcode.

Providing more support for these patients was the underlying motivation for our project.

What it does:

So Long COVID is a desktop application based in Python that enables the user to log and monitor their symptoms, as well as access support resources. A community forum is planned but not yet implemented.

How we built it:

Python! Our website was created with HTML and CSS.

Challenges we ran into:

Differences in time zones resulted in some asynchronicity in communication.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:

Coordinating ourselves as a global team to create a working prototype and learning as we went along!

What we learned:

We learned a good deal of Python, including about managing a GUI, visualizing data, storing persistent data locally etc.

What's next for So Long COVID:

Expanding (or pivoting) the implementation into the app world by working with developers with app experience.
